Hello,

[I don't find how to send a message to you, so I am uploading my query in your repository. I apologize for the same]

I am Amit.
I am a programer but I am new to Github and also to python /selenium etc.
I want to use Selenuim for some particular reason, so I was searching for a framework which I can start with.
I downloaded your repository but I am not getting how to use it.
I installed python 3.7.3 on my machine (Windows 7)
Now I am trying to invoke from command prompt as below but I am getting error.
It will be kind of you to help me.


F:\Amit\GitHub\Mozilla\trunk\TestScripts>c:\python\python.exe mozilla_languagesPage_Test.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
